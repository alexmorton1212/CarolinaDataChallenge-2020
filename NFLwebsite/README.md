# NFL Project Website

This repository contains all the html, rmd, etc. files used to create a local website to display our work for CDC 2020. We couldn't get GitHub to host the site correctly in time so all the formatting was wrong, but it is shown in our video. I'm going to explain how I open the "website" with the steps I took (sorry if you're reading this and know how to do this already).

Download zip file ->
I used VS Code to open it ->
Open terminal for NFLWebsite ->
npm init ->
npm install browser-sync ->
npx browser-sync start -sw
